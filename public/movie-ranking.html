<h1>Best Movies According to Aphrodite </h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Lala Land </h3>
<p>“La La Land” serves to remind us that movies can still be magical, and they can still provide the channel for us to see magic in the world around us. </p>
<h3>Shrek</h3>
<P>No animated being has ever moved, breathed or had its skin crawl quite as convincingly as Shrek, and yet the movie doesn't look like a reprocessed version of the real world; it's all made up, right down to, or up to, Shrek's trumpet-shaped ears.</P>
<h3>Barbie</h3>
<p>Very nice movie, with interesting message.</p>
